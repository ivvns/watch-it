# Movie Website using TMDB Api

Vanilla JS REST API project built using Vite and TailwindCSS.

The website takes data from TMDB api and displays a collection of movies and shows. Many of the sliders are organized in sliders from SliderJS.

Users are able to navigate through terms such as popular, trending, and top rated movies/shows and see additional details when clicked. For TV shows there are additional features such as viewing the current episodes of the season and seeing a list of current and past seasons. Lastly, there is a search function in the navigation which takes the users to a dedicated search results page with all the results as well as pagination.
